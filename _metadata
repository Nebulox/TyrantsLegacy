  "description" : "Why hello! This is my not so triumphant return to actually releasing my mods. I hope you enjoy this one, as it is quite a power fantasy.\n\n[h1]PLEASE NOTE:[/h1]\nThese legs are NOT clientside, if you wish to play with this armour with a friend or on a server, both you and your friend or server must also be subscribed to this mod. It may be incompatible with mods that use neb-rimestriders in their id or file paths.\nIt IS compatible with FU and Elithian Races Mod\n\n[h1]Update 2[/h1]\nHi all! Here is a list of the changes in this update!\n- Altered how you obtain the weapons to be more user friendly \n- Added some secrets to the dungeon\n- Made the dungeon revisitable via a new quest, available to everyone, which takes you to the domain, and gives you a recipe for a \"Domain Beacon\" to visit the domain at will\n- The Domain Beacon is crafted at your hands\n- Keep in mind that you can only obtain one set of Tyrant's gear, but an infinite amount of what the secrets offer\n- Built in skins for when the Revisualiser mod gets released\n- Updates Gerald's health regen to be reasonable\n- This change means that Gerald can now be defeated at T4 with some tactics, T5 with a little difficulty and T6+ comfortably (this is considering ONLY vanilla gear, with modded gear this will become insanely easy - looking into this)\n\n[h1]Draedon is that you!?[/h1]\n[b]Tyrant's Reaper:[/b]\n  Primary:\n- A 10 hit combo of a mixture of flaming slashes and swipes\n- Inflicts inferno\n  Alt:\n- If grounded, leap into the air and create a violent firenado\n- If airborne, initiate the firenado instantly\n- The firenado is a massive area of effect of fire damage, inflicting inferno to targets hit, dealing a massive amount of damage\n\n[b]Tyrant's Armour[/b]\n- A high statted armour, not much special\n- Has a set bonus that gives the Tyrant's Reaper, flaming flying slashes on slashes and alt\n\n[b]Inferno Status Effect[/b]\n- Deals a small amount of the enemies max hp as damage every 0.75 seconds\n- When that tick damage is dealt, send a flaming seeker to the player to heal a small amount\n- On death sends a few more seekers\n- Spreads the effect to nearby enemies\n\n[h1]Notes:[/h1]\n- This is a powerful set to get earlygame, thus it may affect progression immensely\n- The rate Gerald regens increases with the number of players, mildly exponentially\n\n[h1]How to obtain:[/h1]\nTalk to the[b] mysterious ancient key trader[/b] in the outpost.\nAlternatively, cheat..?\n/admin\n/spawnitem neb-tyrantsreaper\n/spawnitem neb-tyrantshead\n/spawnitem neb-tyrantschest\n/spawnitem neb-tyrantslegs\n/admin\n\n[h1]Credits:[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoistCrevace/]Your Generous Benefactor, Nebulox[/url]: The beholder of the entire mod!\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/loiber]Loib[/url]: For creating some ambience for the domain, which references some tracks from Calamity Mod\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/justFrykas]Frykas[/url]: For drawing the dragon impaled by a sword I drew\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaLovingLad/]Tea-Loving Lad[/url]: Worked on the thumbnail and survived some odds.\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198175520766/]zeplayafurn[/url]: Commissioning the weapon and armour! Thanks!\n\n[h1]Greetings? Anyone still here?[/h1]\nI have a patreon [url=https://www.patreon.com/Nebulox]here![/url] It comes with a few perks that we can discuss via Discord DMs!\n\nAlso look forward to my upcoming mods!\n- Revisualiser\nThe skin system, it will release very soon! Skins will often come packed into the mod with the weapon, for example this mod already has the skins in the files, but to use them you need the Revisualiser mod when it releases!\n- Animated Armours\nThis is a package of two mods. One will be the framework and system so other mods can use it, including vanilla compatible ones. And the other is a set of animations for vanilla armour sets to give them some life!\n- Narthex\nA flying blood sword with a full set of flying combos, along with a handheld ability for a movement based combo! It is almost complete and will release soon\n- CityScaper\nA mod similar to the architects table, but is relatively more versatile with some more freedom and control regarding how it works. Allows placing of dungeons and \"rooms\" which will let you build up cities really quickly! Will release with some modules that add custom modded \"rooms\" like Arcana or Shellguard!\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574693146]I made a modding guide! Check it out![/url]\n\nI also hang around a few discord servers:\nThe [url=https://discord.gg/uzFUnT5uDQ]Starforge server[/url]\nMy [url=https://discord.gg/t/mkWruEK]Discord Server[/url]\nThe [url=https://discord.gg/Starbound]Starbound server[/url] \nThe [url=https://discord.gg/t2rWTfJ]Eltihian Alliance server[/url]\n\nI am open to commissions, just DM me on discord, at Nebulox#3969. Don't add me on steam, add me on discord... Please, I'm begging you...\n\nI don't play this game with people, please, please, please, please, please, please stop spamming me. Thanks!",
