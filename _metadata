  "description" : "Why hello! This is my not so triumphant return to actually releasing my mods. I hope you enjoy this one, as it is quite a power fantasy.\n\n[h1]PLEASE NOTE:[/h1]\nThese legs are NOT clientside, if you wish to play with this armour with a friend or on a server, both you and your friend or server must also be subscribed to this mod. It may be incompatible with mods that use neb-rimestriders in their id or file paths.\nIt IS compatible with FU and Elithian Races Mod\n\n[h1]Draedon is that you!?[/h1]\n[b]Tyrant's Reaper:[/b]\n  Primary:\n- A 10 hit combo of a mixture of flaming slashes and swipes\n- Inflicts inferno\n  Alt:\n- If grounded, leap into the air and create a violent firenado\n- If airborne, initiate the firenado instantly\n- The firenado is a massive area of effect of fire damage, inflicting inferno to targets hit, dealing a massive amount of damage\n\n[b]Tyrant's Armour[/b]\n- A high statted armour, not much special\n- Has a set bonus that gives the Tyrant's Reaper, flaming flying slashes on slashes and alt\n\n[b]Inferno Status Effect[/b]\n- Deals a small amount of the enemies max hp as damage every 0.75 seconds\n- When that tick damage is dealt, send a flaming seeker to the player to heal a small amount\n- On death sends a few more seekers\n- Spreads the effect to nearby enemies\n\n[h1]Notes:[/h1]\n- This set is relatively powerful, so do consider this\n- While it is obtainable early with some intuitive measures, the armour is already a high tier, and may break progression\n- The rate Gerald regens increases with the number of players, mildly exponentially\n\n[h1]How to obtain:[/h1]\nTalk to the[b] mysterious ancient key trader[/b] in the outpost.\nAlternatively, cheat..?\n/admin\n/spawnitem neb-tyrantsreaper\n/spawnitem neb-tyrantshead\n/spawnitem neb-tyrantschest\n/spawnitem neb-tyrantslegs\n/admin\n\n[h1]Credits:[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoistCrevace/]Your Generous Benefactor, Nebulox[/url]: The beholder of the entire mod!\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198175520766/]zeplayafurn[/url]: Commissioning the weapon and armour!

I did have a patreon exclusive mod in the works, but due to a lack of supporters it was scrapped, I may bring it back though.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574693146]I made a modding guide!
